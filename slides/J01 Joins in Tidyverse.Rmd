# Why Learn Joins?

???

Machine Learning is usually thought of as a subfield of artificial intelligence that itself contains other hot sub-fields.

Let's start somewhere familiar. I have a data set and I want to analyze it. 

The actual data set is named `ames` and it comes in the `AmesHousing` R package. No need to open your computers. Let's just discuss for a few minutes.

class: middle

# .center[AmesHousing]

Descriptions of 2,930 houses sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010, collected by the Ames Assessor’s Office.

```{r}
# install.packages("AmesHousing")
library(AmesHousing)
ames <- make_ames() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-matches("Qu"))
```

???

`ames` contains descriptions of 2,930 houses sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010. The data comes from the Ames Assessor’s Office and contains things like the square footage of a house, its lot size, and its sale price.

## `r emo::ji("crystal_ball")` for .display[future, yet-to-be-seen data]

.footnote[Max Kuhn & Kjell Johnston, http://www.feat.engineering/]


???

This is our whole game vision for today. This is the main goal for predictive modeling broadly, and for machine learning specifically.

We'll use this goal to drive learning of 3 core tidymodels packages:

- parsnip
- yardstick
- and rsample

# .center[`lm()`]


```{r}
lm_ames <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
lm_ames
```


???

So let's start with prediction. To predict, we have to have two things: a model to generate predictions, and data to predict

This type of formula interface may look familiar

How would we use parsnip to build this kind of linear regression model?

Fill in the blanks. Use `predict()` to

1. Use your linear model to predict sale prices; save the tibble as `price_pred`  
1. Add a pipe and use `mutate()` to add a column with the observed sale prices; name it `truth`
